#Estenics#

##What is it?##
It's a very simple data access tool using the dynamic features of C#. I wrote it as I want to learn more about using dynamics, probably not a good idea to use this in an actual project at this point! 

##Why is it called Estenics?##
I don't know, I just came up with a random name.
